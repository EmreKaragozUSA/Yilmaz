    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Emre, a software engineer with expertise in Python, C#, JavaScript, and Java.  
        I have experience working with unstructured data, cloud platforms like Zoho, and technologies  
        such as Spring Boot and Oracle databases. I enjoy solving complex problems, automating workflows,  
        and continuously learning new tools. Outside of work, I have experience teaching and sharing knowledge on cybersecurity.  
        I also have a deep interest in film and technology. Feel free to explore my content and connect with me through the links below.
